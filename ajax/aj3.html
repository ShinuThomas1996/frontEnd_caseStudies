  <h1>CRICKET GROUNDS</H1>
<img src="c3.jpg"/>
<p>In the game of cricket, the cricket pitch consists of the central strip of the cricket field between the wickets. It is 22 yards (20.12 m) long and 10 feet (3.05 m) wide. The surface is flat and normally covered with extremely short grass though this grass is soon removed by wear at the ends of the pitch.

As almost all deliveries bowled will bounce off the pitch towards the batsmen (and only those not doing so would be in the case of a, usually accidental, full toss delivery), the state and type of a cricket pitch can significantly affect the outcome of a match. For example, a dusty, very dry, pitch will favour spin bowling because the ball will grip more on a dusty pitch - giving the team with the superior spin bowlers a significant advantage in the match.[1] The state of the pitch is so important to the outcome of a cricket match that teams can be fined or docked points if they produce a poor pitch that is deemed unfit for normal play, or seen to be a danger to batsmen by the ball behaving erratically when pitching on it.</p>
